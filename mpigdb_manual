Manual for the mpigdb

You call it in the following way:

mpirun -np X ./mpigdb Y ./executable_file

where X is the number of processors to split the job
and Y is the processor's number whose job you gonna track in emacs 

if additional arguments have to be passed:
1. when in gdb mode - add breakpoints where necessary
2. run the code with necessary arguments:
  (gdb) r arg1 arg2 arg3
